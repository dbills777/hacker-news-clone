## How I worked on this project
My goal was to gain a better understanding of Async/Await, Promises, Consuming Data From an API
- Design was to recreate hacker news as closely as possible.
- Make multiple calls to various hacker news endpoints as needed to recreate the UI.

## Why I built the project this way
- This was my first exposure and learning opportunity regarding Svelte. Although the main focus was to practice API data consumption, adding svelt was a fun learning experience.
- styled-components is a great library for styling. It includes an auto-prefixer, uses scoped
classes, and allows a seamless integration with JS.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually. But for the beginning I focus on the
frontend. That's why I decided to use an existing API rather to create a custom server. I have
basic backend knowledge as well.
- Testing is an essential part of production applications. Testing Library is the go-to library in the
React community. I covered the essential features of the app with tests.
## Points to Improve
- In the future I would like to recreate this application with an isolated component approach.
- Refactor the different methods of fetching data into one consistant form.  ie arrow functions with async and await.
